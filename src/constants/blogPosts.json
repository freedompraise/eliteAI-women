      "For generations, women in underserved communities have struggled against systemic barriers holding them back. Workplace biases have prevented many women from achieving their goals. Insufficient access to education and resources has also obstructed their progress. Could we change that? A greatly better world is possible, where every woman has the tools, skills and opportunities to thrive.",
      "AI Women Rising is a revolutionary initiative that empowers women through technology as well as innovation. AI Women Rising is a movement, not just a program, to \"rewrite the narrative for women who have been left behind,\" and it is led by Blessing Ikpia, Co-founder and Marketing Director of Elite Global AI, with support from Dr. Vwakpor Efeutanu, CEO of Elite Global AI, targeting to bridge the gender inequality and technology gap in underserved areas.",
      "Gender inequality is a pervasive social problem and it is not simply a women's issue. Restricting some women's opportunities harms many families, obstructs large community improvement and obstructs meaningful economic growth. Empowering women strengthens families, communities and economic growth, according to studies. Although much is known, millions of women globally still face important marginalization, especially in technical fields with large gender inequality.",
      "AI presents both challenges and potential. AI is transforming industries along with creating millions of new jobs. Conversely, neglecting to deliberately include women will likely exacerbate existing inequalities. AI Women Rising's function is precisely that.",
      "This initiative will develop women as leaders. They will be leaders, not simply participants, in the AI revolution. We aim to considerably reduce large barriers and create unmatched opportunities for deeply marginalized women by providing them with cutting-edge AI skills, thorough entrepreneurial tools and exhaustive job readiness training.",
      "AI Women Rising empowers women in the tech industry by providing important skills and resources for success. This prepares many women not only for employment, but also to assume several leadership roles, develop many revolutionary solutions and make an important difference in their communities.",
      "Our program's primary focus includes precisely three areas: We offer large foundational artificial intelligence knowledge. We also provide several practical applications in agriculture, healthcare and education. Participants acquire skills in using AI tools for professional and community applications. We equip women with several important skills through workshops and mentorship. These skills—communication, problem-solving, adaptability and leadership—prepare them for the workforce. We provide large resources and thorough guidance to help women entrepreneurs apply AI to innovation and sustainability.",
      "AI Women Rising offers many rewarding aspects. Encountering incredible women whose resilience inspires us daily is one of the best. Our team recently visited an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp in Benin City and this camp offered refuge to many families displaced by violence and terrorism.",
      "There we met Mary, Rebecca and Sawasa—three outstanding women whose individual stories represent both battle and hope. Though they faced unimaginable hardships, such as losing homes, jobs and loved ones, their belief in a brighter future remained. We were inspired by their courage, strengthening our dedication to positive change.",
      "Our initiative provides exceptionally important AI training. This training is offered freely to women and others residing in the camp. AI and entrepreneurship training helps them rebuild their lives and become community leaders.",

      "Their collaboration is building a future where all women can overcome systemic barriers and achieve their full potential.",
      "Discussions about empowering women through technology include individual achievements. These achievements also produce deeply transformative ripple effects that considerably benefit entire communities. This is an explanation. Here's how: Studies show that when women earn more, their families and communities see meaningful benefits, with a reinvestment rate as high as 90%, resulting in large economic growth. Women with high-demand AI skills gain employment and increase local economies. Empowered women inspire social change in their communities by serving as role models. Younger generations find deep inspiration to pursue exceptionally ambitious goals with considerably increased dedication. Innovation thrives on a collection of viewpoints and diverse perspectives generate many better solutions. Women's increased participation in the tech industry promotes innovation, benefiting all.",
      "Persistent stereotypes have obstructed women's improvement, particularly in male-dominated fields such as technology and overcoming these stereotypes is a meaningful hurdle. Many people still think technology is “too complicated” for women and they also believe that men are better suited for leadership positions. These obsolete ideas are both untrue and damaging.",
      "AI Women Rising is dedicated to overcoming common stereotypes; Mary's inspiring story from Benin City shows the potential unleashed when women have equal opportunities.",
      "Call to Action: AI Women Rising is more than just an initiative; it's a rapidly growing movement that needs everyone to work together. We wholeheartedly invite everyone to help us build a deeply better world where gender equality is not just an ideal but a reality.",

      "Women belong in tech, not because companies need diversity, but because women have the skills, the passion, and the creativity to drive innovation.” These words by Anna Radulovski, founder of WomenTech Network, cut through the noise of stereotypes that have long held women back in technology.",
      "Women have demonstrably spearheaded innovation throughout history. Revolutionary figures such as Ada Lovelace, the creator of the first machine algorithm and contemporary leaders including Fei-Fei Li and Rebecca Enonchong provide compelling evidence of this. Harmful stereotypes remain and they have made contributions. These biases obstruct Africa's potential and this weakens a continent wealthy in entrepreneurial spirit and untapped talent.",
      "The persistent stereotype that women lack the technical skills or interest to excel in fields like artificial intelligence (AI), engineering, as well as software development is damaging to many women in tech and this considerably limits their opportunities. This myth has been repeatedly disproven by many data sets and real-world examples. This refers to the entire world. The scope is global.",

      "• Only 11% of startups are led by female CEOs, and just 17% have at least one female co-founder.",
      "• Female-led startups received less than 2% of total venture capital funding in 2023, despite evidence showing their ventures often outperform male-led counterparts.",
      "These figures strongly suggest deeply systemic problems, rather than a simple lack of ability, such as considerably insufficient access to education, mentorship and funding.",
      "Despite facing significant obstacles, African women-led startups consistently deliver exceptional results. According to Illuminate Ventures:",
      "“Women-led tech companies enjoy a 35% higher return on investment than those led by men”.",

In 2023, the company received $21 million in Series B funding, a record investment for an African woman-led healthtech company.

      "2. Funding Disparities",
