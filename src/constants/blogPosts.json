    "content": "For generations, women in underserved communities have struggled against systemic barriers holding them back. Workplace biases have prevented many women from achieving their goals. Insufficient access to education and resources has also obstructed their progress. Could we change that? A greatly better world is possible, where every woman has the tools, skills and opportunities to thrive.\n\nAI Women Rising is a revolutionary initiative that empowers women through technology as well as innovation. AI Women Rising is a movement, not just a program, to \"rewrite the narrative for women who have been left behind,\" and it is led by Blessing Ikpia, Co-founder and Marketing Director of Elite Global AI, with support from Dr. Vwakpor Efeutanu, CEO of Elite Global AI, targeting to bridge the gender inequality and technology gap in underserved areas.\n\nGender inequality is a pervasive social problem and it is not simply a women's issue. Restricting some women's opportunities harms many families, obstructs large community improvement and obstructs meaningful economic growth. Empowering women strengthens families, communities and economic growth, according to studies. Although much is known, millions of women globally still face important marginalization, especially in technical fields with large gender inequality.\n\nAI presents both challenges and potential. AI is transforming industries along with creating millions of new jobs. Conversely, neglecting to deliberately include women will likely exacerbate existing inequalities. AI Women Rising's function is precisely that.\n\nThis initiative will develop women as leaders. They will be leaders, not simply participants, in the AI revolution. We aim to considerably reduce large barriers and create unmatched opportunities for deeply marginalized women by providing them with cutting-edge AI skills, thorough entrepreneurial tools and exhaustive job readiness training.\n\nAI Women Rising empowers women in the tech industry by providing important skills and resources for success. This prepares many women not only for employment, but also to assume several leadership roles, develop many revolutionary solutions and make an important difference in their communities.\n\nOur program's primary focus includes precisely three areas: We offer large foundational artificial intelligence knowledge. We also provide several practical applications in agriculture, healthcare and education. Participants acquire skills in using AI tools for professional and community applications. We equip women with several important skills through workshops and mentorship. These skills—communication, problem-solving, adaptability and leadership—prepare them for the workforce. We provide large resources and thorough guidance to help women entrepreneurs apply AI to innovation and sustainability.\n\nAI Women Rising offers many rewarding aspects. Encountering incredible women whose resilience inspires us daily is one of the best. Our team recently visited an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp in Benin City and this camp offered refuge to many families displaced by violence and terrorism.\n\nThere we met Mary, Rebecca and Sawasa—three outstanding women whose individual stories represent both battle and hope. Though they faced unimaginable hardships, such as losing homes, jobs and loved ones, their belief in a brighter future remained. We were inspired by their courage, strengthening our dedication to positive change.\n\nOur initiative provides exceptionally important AI training. This training is offered freely to women and others residing in the camp. AI and entrepreneurship training helps them rebuild their lives and become community leaders.\n\nBlessing Ikpia leads AI Women Rising. She is a passionate advocate for meaningful gender equality along with large technical empowerment. Blessing, Co-founder and Marketing Director of Elite Global AI, has many years of experience. This experience has enabled her to lead impactful initiatives creating opportunities for underserved communities. Her large leadership and Dr. Vwakpor Efeutanu's meaningful expertise are key to this program. Dr. Efeutanu, Elite Global AI's highly accomplished CEO, offers a perceptive vision of using technology to solve social problems, providing strong analytical understanding.\n\nTheir collaboration is building a future where all women can overcome systemic barriers and achieve their full potential.\n\nDiscussions about empowering women through technology include individual achievements. These achievements also produce deeply transformative ripple effects that considerably benefit entire communities. This is an explanation. Here's how: Studies show that when women earn more, their families and communities see meaningful benefits, with a reinvestment rate as high as 90%, resulting in large economic growth. Women with high-demand AI skills gain employment and increase local economies. Empowered women inspire social change in their communities by serving as role models. Younger generations find deep inspiration to pursue exceptionally ambitious goals with considerably increased dedication. Innovation thrives on a collection of viewpoints and diverse perspectives generate many better solutions. Women's increased participation in the tech industry promotes innovation, benefiting all.\n\nPersistent stereotypes have obstructed women's improvement, particularly in male-dominated fields such as technology and overcoming these stereotypes is a meaningful hurdle. Many people still think technology is “too complicated” for women and they also believe that men are better suited for leadership positions. These obsolete ideas are both untrue and damaging.\n\nAI Women Rising is dedicated to overcoming common stereotypes; Mary's inspiring story from Benin City shows the potential unleashed when women have equal opportunities.\n\nCall to Action: AI Women Rising is more than just an initiative; it's a rapidly growing movement that needs everyone to work together. We wholeheartedly invite everyone to help us build a deeply better world where gender equality is not just an ideal but a reality.\n\nSeveral methods exist for participation. Here is how you can get involved: Broadly sharing our mission within your networks will greatly expand our reach, substantially helping us connect with many more women who could benefit from this program. Join forces with us: Whether you are a meaningful organization seeking a collaborative partnership or an individual excited to contribute some of your important time or specialized expertise, we enthusiastically welcome your large input. Your donations provide important training materials, many mentorship programs and other important resources that empower many women.\n\nAI Women Rising is fundamentally about hope: hope for many women thriving, hope for countless empowered communities and hope for technology promoting equality.\n\nEmpowered women strengthen families, building strong communities that create a more equitable world.\n\nLet's rise up together!"

    "excerpt": "Women belong in tech, not because companies need diversity, but because women have the skills...",
    "content": "Women belong in tech, not because companies need diversity, but because women have the skills, the passion, and the creativity to drive innovation.” These words by Anna Radulovski, founder of WomenTech Network, cut through the noise of stereotypes that have long held women back in technology.\n\nWomen have demonstrably spearheaded innovation throughout history. Revolutionary figures such as Ada Lovelace, the creator of the first machine algorithm and contemporary leaders including Fei-Fei Li and Rebecca Enonchong provide compelling evidence of this. Harmful stereotypes remain and they have made contributions. These biases obstruct Africa's potential and this weakens a continent wealthy in entrepreneurial spirit and untapped talent.\n\nThe persistent stereotype that women lack the technical skills or interest to excel in fields like artificial intelligence (AI), engineering, as well as software development is damaging to many women in tech and this considerably limits their opportunities. This myth has been repeatedly disproven by many data sets and real-world examples. This refers to the entire world. The scope is global.\n\nA simple 43% of STEM graduates in India are women, showing that technical skill is not determined by gender.\n\nWomen in Sub-Saharan Africa make up 30% of the tech workforce, a number that continues to grow despite systemic barriers.\n\nHowever, representation alone does not tell the full story. In Africa’s tech ecosystem:\n\n• Only 11% of startups are led by female CEOs, and just 17% have at least one female co-founder.\n\n• Female-led startups received less than 2% of total venture capital funding in 2023, despite evidence showing their ventures often outperform male-led counterparts.\n\nThese figures strongly suggest deeply systemic problems, rather than a simple lack of ability, such as considerably insufficient access to education, mentorship and funding.\n\nDespite facing significant obstacles, African women-led startups consistently deliver exceptional results. According to Illuminate Ventures:\n\n“Women-led tech companies enjoy a 35% higher return on investment than those led by men”.\n\nThis achievement is due to the special strengths women bring to leadership roles:\n\nWomen are greatly more likely to develop many solutions that address many large social challenges such as healthcare access along with education inequality, a phenomenon known as empathy-driven innovation.\n\nWomen are key drivers of an important amount of economic growth. This large contribution is due to women reinvesting up to 90% of their earnings into their families and communities, while men typically reinvest only 30–40%.\n\nJoanna Bichsel is the leader of Kasha, a Rwandan healthtech startup. In 2023, the company received $21 million in Series B funding, a record investment for an African woman-led healthtech company. Kasha's accomplishments show the capacity of women-led businesses to encourage meaningful innovation and positive change.\n\nMany African women are overcoming important technical hurdles, despite facing large challenges.\n\nRebecca Enonchong is from Cameroon.\n\nRebecca, known as the “Queen of African Tech,” created AppsTech, a global enterprise software company. She ardently champions gender equality in the tech industry, while also mentoring promising young female entrepreneurs throughout Africa.\n\nHilda Moraa is from Kenya. That is her only location.\n\nAs the innovating founder of Pezesha, a revolutionary fintech platform providing meaningful credit access to many small businesses, Hilda is substantially empowering many entrepreneurs while dealing with financial inclusion.\n\nKenya is represented by one Mary Mwangi.\n\nMary’s Data Integrated Limited provides thorough digital payment solutions to many small businesses throughout East Africa, thereby easing important functional modernization as well as promoting strong growth.\n\nThese narratives show what happens when women lead.\n\nUnlocking the full potential of many African women in tech requires dealing with several systemic barriers:\n\nThe Challenges We Must Address\n\nTo fully unlock the potential of African women in tech, we must confront several systemic barriers:\n\n1. Access to Education\n\nOnly 30% of Sub-Saharan African women pursue careers in STEM, often due to cultural biases and financial constraints. Initiatives like coding bootcamps, scholarships for girls, and mentorship programs can help bridge this gap.\n\n2. Funding Disparities\n\nIn 2024 alone, female-led startups raised just $48 million—only 2% of total venture capital funding on the continent. Gender-lens investing strategies that prioritize female founders are crucial for addressing this imbalance.\n\n3. Workplace Bias\n\nEven when women enter tech roles, they face discrimination and limited opportunities for advancement. Globally, only 26.7% of technology jobs are held by women, with even lower representation at leadership levels.\n\n4. Cultural Stereotypes\n\nDeeply ingrained societal norms often discourage girls from pursuing technical careers or leadership roles in tech companies. Changing this narrative requires showcasing role models who defy these stereotypes.\n\nAfrican women have qualities ideal for leadership in technology.\n\nAfrican women show outstanding resilience through their multidimensional roles as caregivers and entrepreneurs, overcoming meaningful systemic barriers while exhibiting extraordinary adaptability and advanced problem-solving skills.\n\nAfrican women's primary role in household decision-making gives them unrivaled comprehension into consumer needs, making them important for product development.\n\nWomen's organizational leadership prioritizes long-term social benefits. This shows visionary qualities.\n\nFei-Fei Li, co-director of Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute, once said: “Technology is a reflection of humanity; it’s about people.” Women’s innate ability to balance empathy with innovation makes them ideal leaders in this space.\n\nThe time has come to move beyond stereotypes as well as to invest greatly in the large potential of many African women in technology. This is how we can make it happen and this is our plan.\n\nSupport many diverse educational programs.\n\nPrioritizing STEM education for girls requires collaboration between governments as well as private organizations, using scholarships along with school partnerships.\n\nFully fund the project\n\nInvestors should use gender-lens investing strategies that stress female-led startups and they should also offer mentorship to aspiring entrepreneurs to succeed.\n\nPromoting many role models will have a positive effect.\n\nRebecca Enonchong and Hilda Moraa have achieved impactful successes. These successes can greatly inspire future women in tech leadership.\n\nCreate all-embracing workplaces, along with cultivating them deeply.\n\nCompanies need policies and training programs at every level, from entry-level to executive positions, to promote diversity and address workplace bias.\n\nAnna Radulovski powerfully points out this battle's importance with her perceptive statement: “Women belong in tech—not because companies need diversity but because they have the skills to drive innovation.” The deeply flawed concept that women lack technical skills is completely unacceptable in an energetic continent such as Africa.\n\nAfrican women are confident leaders in technology's future."

    "excerpt": "Resilience is knowing that you are the only one who has the power and the responsibility to pick yourself up",
    "content": "Resilience is knowing that you are the only one who has the power and the responsibility to pick yourself up.” A message Mary Holloway delivers powerfully, particularly to women in challenging fields like tech. Whether it’s technology, engineering, or any other traditionally male-led industry, the challenges can feel overwhelming. From being underestimated to feeling isolated, the journey often feels lonely. But here’s the truth: women have always risen above these barriers and you can too.\n\nFor women in underserved regions, particularly in Africa, these challenges can feel even heavier. Limited resources, cultural expectations, and systemic barriers make it harder to thrive in environments that weren’t built with women in mind. But thriving is possible. Emotional resilience is not just about surviving; it’s about finding strength within yourself and creating a support system that helps you grow.\n\nLet’s talk about how we can do that together.\nOne of the hardest parts of working in a male-dominated field is the isolation. Picture this: you're the only woman in a room of men, encountering difficulties where your ideas are questioned and your skills doubted—not due to error, but solely because of your gender. It is completely and deeply exhausting. Research shows that women in these settings often feel excluded and undervalued. A 2024 USAID report indicates that women hold a simple 28 percent of STEM jobs globally. They also occupy a considerably smaller percentage of leadership roles in these fields. African numbers, particularly in remote or underserved rural areas, are greatly lower.\n\nBut here’s the thing: you don’t have to go through it alone. Finding a community of like-minded women can make all the difference. Whether it’s joining a WhatsApp group or a forum like AI Women Rising, connecting with others who understand your struggles can provide comfort and encouragement. Sheryl Sandberg once said: “We need to make it as easy as possible for women to help each other.” And she’s right—because when women come together, incredible things happen.\n\nAnother challenge many women face is managing stress and mental health. Let’s be honest: juggling work, family responsibilities, and societal expectations can take a toll on anyone. For women in Africa, where access to mental health resources is limited, this struggle can feel even more isolating. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression affects almost 6% of African women and anxiety affects 5%; however, these numbers are probably underreported because of the stigma associated with mental health.\n\nBut there are tools out there to help you manage stress and protect your well-being. Apps like Wysa offer free emotional support through AI-driven conversations, helping you work through feelings of anxiety or burnout. If mindfulness is your thing, apps like Calm or Headspace provide guided meditations tailored for busy professionals. In the AI Women Rising community, we prioritize your mental well-being by providing access to mental health advocates who offer the support needed to ease your mind and promote emotional balance. Remember, taking care of your mental health isn’t selfish, it’s necessary.\n\nMaya Angelou once said: “You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated.” Prioritizing your mental health is one way to ensure you keep moving forward.\n\nIt also helps to find mentors, people who have walked this path before you and can guide you through its twists and turns. A mentor doesn’t have to be someone famous; it could be a colleague, a family member, or even someone you admire from afar and definitely it could be us in the AI Women Rising community. The World Bank Gender Innovation Lab has shown that mentorship significantly improves career outcomes for women in competitive industries.\n\nFinally and this might be the most important part, celebrate your wins. It doesn’t matter how small they seem; every step forward is progress worth acknowledging. Maybe you spoke up in a meeting where you’d usually stay quiet. Maybe you completed a project despite doubting yourself at first. Whatever it is, take a moment to recognize what you’ve achieved.\n\nNelson Mandela once said: “The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling but in rising every time we fall.” Celebrating your victories reminds you of your strength and keeps you motivated for what’s next.\n\nResilience doesn’t mean pretending everything is fine when it isn’t. It means finding ways to adapt and grow despite the challenges around you. It means leaning on others when you need support and giving yourself grace when things get tough.\nTo every woman navigating male-dominated fields: You are not alone. The road may be hard, but every step forward matters not just for you but for every girl watching and dreaming of following in your footsteps.\nKeep going, you’ve got this!"
